Description: WSJT-X - Digital Modes for Weak Signal Communicaitons in Amateur Radio.
 WSJT-X is a computer program designed to facilitate basic amateur
 radio communication using very weak signals. The first four letters in
 the program name stand for `(W)eak (S)ignal communication by
 K1(JT),` while the suffix `-X` indicates that WSJT-X started as
 an extended and experimental branch of the program
 WSJT.
 .
 WSJT-X Version 1.8 offers nine different protocols or modes: FT8,
 JT4, JT9, JT65, QRA64, ISCAT, MSK144, WSPR, and Echo.
 The first five are designed for making reliable QSOs under extreme
 weak-signal conditions. They use nearly identical message structure
 and source encoding.  JT65 and QRA64 were designed for EME
 (`moonbounce`) on the VHF/UHF bands and have also proven very
 effective for worldwide QRP communication on the HF bands.  QRA64 has
 a number of advantages over JT65, including better performance on the
 very weakest signals.  We imagine that over time it may replace JT65
 for EME use.  JT9 was originally designed for the LF, MF, and lower HF
 bands.  Its submode JT9A is 2 dB more sensitive than JT65 while using
 less than 10% of the bandwidth.  JT4 offers a wide variety of tone
 spacings and has proven highly effective for EME on microwave bands up
 to 24 GHz.  These four `slow` modes use one-minute timed sequences
 of alternating transmission and reception, so a minimal QSO takes four
 to six minutes — two or three transmissions by each station, one
 sending in odd UTC minutes and the other even.  FT8 is operationally
 similar but four times faster (15-second T/R sequences) and less
 sensitive by a few dB.  On the HF bands, world-wide QSOs are possible
 with any of these modes using power levels of a few watts (or even
 milliwatts) and compromise antennas.  On VHF bands and higher, QSOs
 are possible (by EME and other propagation types) at signal levels 10
 to 15 dB below those required for CW.
 .
 ISCAT, MSK144, and optionally submodes JT9E-H are `fast`
 protocols designed to take advantage of brief signal enhancements from
 ionized meteor trails, aircraft scatter, and other types of scatter
 propagation. These modes use timed sequences of 5, 10, 15, or 30 s
 duration.  User messages are transmitted repeatedly at high rate (up
 to 250 characters per second, for MSK144) to make good use of the
 shortest meteor-trail reflections or `pings`.  ISCAT uses free-form
 messages up to 28 characters long, while MSK144 uses the same
 structured messages as the slow modes and optionally an abbreviated
 format with hashed callsigns.
 .
 WSPR (pronounced `whisper`) stands for (W)eak (S)ignal
 (P)ropagation (R)eporter.  The WSPR protocol was designed for probing
 potential propagation paths using low-power transmissions. WSPR
 messages normally carry the transmitting station’s callsign, grid
 locator, and transmitter power in dBm, and they can be decoded at
 signal-to-noise ratios as low as -28 dB in a 2500 Hz bandwidth.  WSPR
 users with internet access can automatically upload reception
 reports to a central database called wsprnet that provides a mapping
 facility, archival storage, and many other features.
 .
 Echo mode allows you to detect and measure your own station's echoes
 from the moon, even if they are far below the audible threshold.
 .
 WSJT-X provides spectral displays for receiver passbands as wide as
 5 kHz, flexible rig control for nearly all modern radios used by
 amateurs, and a wide variety of special aids such as automatic Doppler
 tracking for EME QSOs and Echo testing.  The program runs equally well
 on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux systems, and installation packages
 are available for all three platforms.
